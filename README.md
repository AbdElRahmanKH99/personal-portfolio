## Built With

- **HTML5** – For the structure of the website.
- **CSS3** – For styling and layout.
- **SASS** – A CSS preprocessor that helps with easier management of styles.
- **Flexbox** – Used for flexible layouts and to create responsive designs.
- **CSS Grid** – Used for grid-based layouts.

## What I Learned

In this project, I honed my skills in responsive web design by:
- Structuring clean and semantic HTML.
- Utilizing **SASS** for better style management and modularity.
- Creating complex layouts using **CSS Flexbox** and **Grid**.
- Ensuring the website is fully responsive across various devices.

Here’s a small example of code I’m proud of:
```scss
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
  padding: 1rem;
}
```
